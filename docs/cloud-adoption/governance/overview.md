# Enterprise Cloud Adoption: Governance overview

Governance is a broadly used term. Throughout the Enterprise Cloud Adoption (ECA) framework, the topic of governance focuses on actionable governance practices, which include policies, enforcement, and the five disciplines of cloud governance. Each of these facets of governance is vital to ensure Cloud Adoption is safely governed.

**Policy & Compliance:** The cloud offers many options for implementing management tools. However, a tool that is not grounded in pragmatic policies can't provide true governance. When defining a cloud governance strategy, it is wise to start with existing corporate policy, but apply a Growth Mindset accepting the inevitability of policy change. 

In some cases, [regulatory compliance](policy-compliance/what-is-regulatory-compliance.md) will supercede corporate policy and require a set of more stringent guidelines. Enforceable yet flexible policies are the root of any mature governance strategy. When policies accurately reflect tangible risks and the business' tolerance for risk, as opposed to technical dogma, the policies and resultant strategy can be molded to align with the Cloud, or any other form of technical deployment.

**Management Disciplines:** This framework focuses on five disciplines of cloud governance, each implements a different aspect of corporate policies to support safe Cloud Adoption. Those disciplines include [Cost Management](cost-management/overview.md), [Security Management](security-management/overview.md), [Identity Management](identity-management/overview.md), [Resource Management](resource-management/overview.md), and [Configuration Management](configuration-management/overview.md). When policy focuses on risk & tolerance, management disciplines can extend those policies by applying proper risk mitigation to the chosen [deployment model](../getting-started/cloud-deployment-models.md).

**Monitoring & Enforcement:** Throughout ECA, monitoring & enforcement focuses on the tools and approaches that enable effective enforcement of policy across multiple management disciplines. In this context, Monitoring & Enforcement includes logging, monitoring, notification, and automated enforcement of policy & compliance across management disciplines and [deployment models](../getting-started/cloud-deployment-models.md).

## Next steps

The first step to taking action in any governance strategy, is a [policy review](policy-compliance/overview.md). [Policy and Compliance](policy-compliance/overview.md) could be a useful guide during your policy review. As a CISO, you can prepare for a policy review by reviewing the [guide to cloud readiness for CISOs](how-can-a-ciso-prepare-for-the-cloud.md).
