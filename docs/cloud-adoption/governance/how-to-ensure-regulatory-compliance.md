# Enterprise Cloud Adoption: Ensuring Regulatory Compliance

Managing regulatory compliance can be a complex task. For multinational organizations (particularly those in heavily regulated industries such as healthcare and financial services), compliance can be even more challenging. Standards and regulations abound and, of course, they change frequently, making it difficult for businesses to keep abreast of all the international electronic data handling laws.

As with security controls, businesses should understand the division of responsibilities regarding regulatory compliance in the cloud. Cloud providers make an effort to ensure that their platforms and services are compliant, but companies also need to confirm that their applications, or those supplied by third parties, are compliant.
Similarly, applications in regulated industries that use cloud services might require certification from the cloud provider. 

## HIPAA

A healthcare application that processes protected health information (PHI) is subject to both the Privacy Rule and the Security Rule encompassed within the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). At minimum, HIPAA could require that a healthcare business receive written assurances from the cloud provider that it will safeguard any PHI received or created.

## PCI

Another important regulation is the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), a proprietary information security standard for organizations that handle branded credit cards from the major card schemes including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB. The PCI standard is mandated by the card brands and administered by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. The standard was created to increase controls around cardholder data to reduce credit-card fraud. Validation of compliance is performed annually, either by an external Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) or by a firm-specific Internal Security Assessor (ISA) who creates a Report on Compliance (ROC) for organizations handling large volumes of transactions, or by a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) for companies.

## PII

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) consists of any data point that could be used to identify a consumer, employee, partner, or any other living or legal entity. Many emerging laws, particularly those dealing with privacy and individual PII, require that businesses themselves comply and report on compliance and any breaches that might occur.

## GDPR
One of the most important developments in this area is the recent enactment by the European Commission of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), designed to strengthen data protection for individuals within the European Union. The GDPR requires that data about individuals, such as “a name, a home address, a photo, an email address, bank details, posts on social networking websites, medical information, or a computer’s IP address,” be maintained on servers within the EU and not transferred out of it. It also requires that companies notify individuals of any data breaches, and mandates that companies have a Data Protection Officer. Other countries have, or are developing, similar types of regulations.

To help customers meet their own compliance obligations across regulated industries and markets worldwide, Azure maintains the largest compliance portfolio in the industry—both in terms of breadth (total number of offerings), as well as depth (number of customer-facing services in assessment scope). Azure compliance offerings are grouped into four segments: globally applicable, US government, industry specific, and region/country specific.

Azure compliance offerings are based on various types of assurances, including formal certifications, attestations, validations, authorizations, and assessments produced by independent third-party auditing firms, as well as contractual amendments, self-assessments, and customer guidance documents produced by Microsoft. Each offering description in this document provides an up-to-date scope statement indicating which Azure customer-facing services are in scope for the assessment, as well as links to downloadable resources to assist customers with their own compliance obligations.

More detailed information about Azure compliance offerings is available from the [Trust Center](https://aka.ms/allcompliance). Moreover, all downloadable documentation is available to Azure customers under a nondisclosure agreement from the [Service Trust Portal](https://aka.ms/stp) in the following sections:

* Audit reports: Includes FedRAMP, GRC assessment, ISO, PCI DSS, and SOC reports sections
