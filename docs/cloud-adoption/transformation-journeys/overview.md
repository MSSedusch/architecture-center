# Enterprise Cloud Adoption: Transformation Journeys

The cloud is changing how companies consume technology and how business can be delivered. The cloud also enables innovation, which is key given that the goal of most organizations’ strategy is to create competitive differentiation and advantage. Cloud adoption is on the rise, with 87 percent of organizations indicating that they plan to merge their
on-premises datacenter with a hybrid cloud or the public cloud, based on a recent survey (2017 IDC Worldwide Public Cloud Services Spending Guide).  Worldwide spending on public cloud services and infrastructure is forecast to reach 160 billion USD in 2018, an increase of 23 percent over 2017.

The cloud provides the freedom to deploy, build, and manage applications on a massive, global network using existing tools and frameworks. Public and hybrid cloud solutions provide means of increasing efficiency and productivity, while simultaneously reducing IT operating expenses (OpEx). Taking advantage of scale and consumption-based billing, provides access to services that might otherwise be far beyond an organization’s means to implement.

With these benefits come increased options and increase complexity. Each Transformation Journey within the [Enterprise Cloud Adoption (ECA) framework](../../overview.md) is designed to reduce complexity by defining a personalized journey that fits specific customer objectives or Business Outcomes.

## Transformation Journeys

The ECA Governance Board is currently developing three journeys to create focus and clarity for Azure customers. Each Transformation Journey defines a common set of Business, Culture, and Technologies strategies that help streamline the process of adopting cloud technologies.

## Transformation Journey Roadmap

**Operational Transformation**: The majority of businesses leveraging the cloud today, are focused on transforming IT operations and other business operations. Efficiency and Agility are the most common Business Outcomes in this type of transformation. Reducing Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by "getting out of the data center business" and Increasing Business Agility by streamlining IT operations, tend to be amongst the most common Business Outcomes.

**Incremental Transformation**: The pace of change in the business world continues to accelerate. To survive competitive scenarios, companies of all shapes and sizes are expected to move quickly and iterate fast. When companies attempt to grow market share or capitalize on market changes, the ability to listen, respond, and lead is a must. Incremental Transformation focuses on leveraging the cloud to ingrain development teams with a customer obsession and rapid DevOps practices. Incrementally improve application and data capacities through this transformation journey.

**Disruptive Transformation**: Incremental and operational change are great; when applications, data, & processes are already driving revenue. New markets and radical disruptions of existing markets require different approaches. In today's society, data drives opportunity. New forms and sources of data are now available. Ambient technologies surround us at work and home. The average automobile generates more data per hour of driving, than the entire Apollo 11 lunar landing program. Consuming, managing, interpreting and predicting data in disruptive transformations requires modern approaches to services, applications, and data management. The cloud enables these tools and technologies; Disruptive Transformation equips businesses to use them wisely.
