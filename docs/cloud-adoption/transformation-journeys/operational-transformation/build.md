# Enterprise Cloud Adoption: Build the foundation for Operational Transformation Journey (OTJ)

[Operational Transformation](overview.md) is one of the [Transformation Journeys](../overview.md) included in the [Enterprise Cloud Adoption (ECA) framework](../../overview.md). The objective of an Operational Transformation, is the enablement and realization of internal business outcomes. Often times these outcomes center around increased efficiencies, reduced complexity, and improved agility. This article focuses on the Build process within a transformation.

## Business Activities

The following activities align help expand the business vision and build the relationships needed to coordinate bus/tech execution.

* [Global Markets](../business-strategy/global-markets.md): .
* [Stakeholder Alignment](../business-strategy/stakeholder-alignment.md): .
* [Business Reviews](../business-strategy/business-reviews.md): .

## Culture Activities

## Technology Activities

Technology changes can empower and accelerate business outcomes. The following activities are designed to translate business outcomes to actionable technology strategies.

* [Digital Estate Planning](../migration/plan/digital-estate-planning.md): Technology planning begins with an understanding of current state. In an Operational Transformation, current state is defined by the assets in the existing digital estate that supports the business. Digital Estate Planning activities attempt to collect important data about those assets and establish a collective inventory of assets (aka Digital Estate). Once inventoried, a high level plan and top-down forecasting is possible.
* [Rationalize Inventory](../migration/plan/rationalize.md): Building on the Digital Estate, Inventory Rationalization is the first true "Architecture" activity. In this set of activities, the estate is classified into application architypes and a tentative future state is selected (Later phases will test and validate these early assumptions)
* [Prioritize Workloads](../migration/plan/prioritize-workloads.md): This is the point where theory shapes reality. The Cloud Strategy Team reviews the list of assets slated for migration against business priorities. This activity balances risk, cost of migration, speed of migration, and operational readiness. The output is a list of workloads aligned to an initial time horizon for release and adoption. This serves as a the change management plan to guide the transformation.
* [Technical Spikes / POCs](../migration/plan/technical-spike-poc.md): A rationalized inventory will expose gaps in the initial Digital Estate Plan. Business and Technical assumptions will be identified. Technical Spikes, and to a lesser degree, Proof of Concepts (POCs), create an opportunity to test assumptions, and build understanding/consensus.

## Next steps

Each of the sections above are designed to personalize next steps. If none of those align with specific needs, [Business Outcomes](../business-strategy/business-outcomes/overview.md) may be a wise next step.

When planning is complete, this journey is ready to advance to the [Build process](build.md).
