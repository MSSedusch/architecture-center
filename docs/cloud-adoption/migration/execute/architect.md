# Enterprise Cloud Adoption: Guidance to prepare workload architecture prior to migration

The [Migration section](../overview.md) of the [Enterprise Cloud Adoption framework](../../overview.md), outlines the processes typically required to migrate a datacenter to the cloud. This article, expands on the [Migration Execution Process](overview.md)by reviewing activities associated with defining the Architecture of a workload within a given iteration.

Coming Soon...

## Next steps

Once the new architecture is defined, [Remediation activities](assess.md) are a logical next step.
If no remediation is required in a given iteration, [Replication activities](remediate.md) may be more appropriate.
