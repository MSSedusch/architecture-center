# Enterprise Cloud Adoption: Understanding Migration Options

The [Migration section](overview.md) of the [Enterprise Cloud Adoption framework](../../overview.md), outlines the processes typically required to migrate a datacenter to the cloud. This section extends the migration conversation by focusing on the [Execution of actual migration work](overview.md).

## What happens after you have developed a [migration plan & strategy](../plan/overview.md) and [built out an Azure environment for migration](../build/overview.md)?

Now it’s time to start the [migration process](../migrate/overview.md). In this process, the team will perform the actual migration of apps to the cloud.
Unlike the collaborative and problem solving tasks in [Plan](../plan/overview.md) and [Build](../build/overview.md), migration tends to be repetitive & largely turnkey.

During Plan, Build, or Migrate, a company generally has three execution options:

* Guided self-service: Existing technical team will execute the migration, with help from Microsoft
* Microsoft FastTrack for Azure: Use the Microsoft FastTrack program for Azure to accelerate migration
* Solutions partner: Get connected with Microsoft Cloud Solution Partners (CSPs) to accelerate migration

## Guided Self-Service

If an organization is planning an Azure migration on its own, Microsoft is always there to assist throughout the migration journey. To help fast-track migration to Azure, Microsoft and its partners have developed an extensive set of architectures, guides, tools, and services to reduce risk and speed migration of virtual machines, applications, and databases. These tools and services support a broad selection of operating systems, programming languages, frameworks, and databases.

* Assessment and migration tools: Azure allows you to leverage a wide range of tools to be used in different phases for your cloud transformation, including assessing your existing infrastructure. For more details on the tool, you can refer to the Assess section in the Migration chapter below.
* [Enterprise Cloud Adoption framework](../../overview.md): This guide presents a structured approach for [migrating to Azure](../overview.md). It is based on proven practices that Microsoft has prepared from different customer engagements. It is organized as a series of steps, from architecture and design to implementation. For each step, supporting guidance will help you with the design of your application architecture.
* [Cloud design patterns](../../../patterns/): Azure provides a number of useful cloud design patterns for building reliable, scalable, secure applications in the cloud. Each pattern describes the problem that the pattern addresses, considerations for applying the pattern, and an example based on Azure. Most of the patterns include code samples or snippets that show how to implement the pattern on Azure. However, most of the patterns are relevant to any distributed system, whether hosted on Azure or on other cloud platforms.
* [Cloud fundamentals](../../../building-blocks/): Fundamental help teach the basic approaches to implementation of core concepts. This guide helps technicians think about solutions that go beyond a single Azure service.
* [Example Scenarios](../../../example-scenario/): The guide provides references from real customer implementations, outlining the tools, approaches, and processes that past customers have followed to accomplish specific business goals.
* [Reference architectures](../../../reference-architectures/): Reference architectures are arranged by scenario, with related architectures grouped together. Each architecture includes recommended practices, along with considerations for scalability, availability, manageability, and security. Most also include a deployable solution.

## Microsoft FastTrack for Azure
[FastTrack for Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/roadmap/fasttrack-for-azure/)  provides direct assistance from Azure engineers, working hand in hand with partners, to help customers build Azure solutions quickly and confidently. FastTrack brings best practices and tools from real customer experiences to guide customers from setup, configuration, and development to production of Azure solutions, including:

* Development and test
* Backup and archive
* Disaster recovery
* App modernization
* App lift and shift
* Digital marketing
* E-commerce
* Data warehouse
* Database migration
* SAP on Azure
* RedHat on Azure*
* Intelligent Apps*
* IoT*
* High-performance computing*

*Available in Q2 of 2018

During a typical FastTrack for Azure engagement, Microsoft will help define the business vision to plan and develop Azure solutions successfully. The team will assess architectural needs and provide guidance, design principles, tools, and resources to help build, deploy, and manage Azure solutions. They will match skilled partners for deployment services on request and will periodically check in to ensure deployment is on track and help remove blockers.

The main phases of a typical FastTrack for Azure engagement are:

* Discovery: Identify key stakeholders, understand the goal or vision for problems to be solved. Then assess architectural needs
* Solution enablement: Learn design principles for building applications, review architecture of applications and solutions, and receive guidance and tools to drive proof of concept (PoC) work through to production
* Continuous partnership: Azure engineers and/or program managers will check in periodically to ensure deployment is on track and help remove blockers

## Azure Solutions Partner

Microsoft certified solution providers specialize in providing up-to-date, Microsoft technology-based customer solutions all over the world. Optimize your business in the cloud with help from an experienced partner.

Get help from partners with ready-made or custom Azure solutions and partners who can help deploy and manage those solutions:

* [Find a Cloud Solutions Partner](https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers/home/) – A certified CSP can help take full advantage of the cloud by assessing business goals for cloud adoption, identifying the right cloud solution that meets business needs and help the business become more agile and efficient.
* [Find a Managed Service Partner](https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers/search?cacheId=16a3b49b-fef2-449d-bdf0-628008114cca) – Azure Managed Service Partner (MSP) helps transition to Azure by guiding all aspects of the cloud journey. From consulting to migrations and operations management, cloud MSPs show customers all the benefits that come with cloud adoption. They also act as a one-stop shop for common support, provisioning, and billing experience—all with a flexible pay-as-you-go (PAYG) business model.

## Next steps

Once a migration path is chosen, continue to the [Migrate section](overview.md) of the [Enterprise Cloud Adoption framework](../../overview.md), to learn about the migration process.
